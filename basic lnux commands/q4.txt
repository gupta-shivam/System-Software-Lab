On measuring DHCPDISCOVER frame the diagnoser moves from $ O $-node $ z_0 $ to
$ z_1 $ via the $ G $-transition $ \tau_1 \text{ or } \tau'_1 $. As $ \tau_1\
\text{and}\ \tau'_1 $ are measurement equivalent it cannot be ascertained at
this point whether an attack has taken place or not. Eventually it can be seen
that on measuring the DHCPREQUEST frame the diagnoser reaches the $ O $-node $
z_7 $. The diagnoser measures the
DHCP-PROBE-RESPONSE-OFFER frame which results in measurement inconsistency, as
no outgoing transition from $ O $-node $ z_7 $ consists of the
DHCP-PROBE-RESPONSE-OFFER event (transition $ \tau'_{15} $). So the estimator
diagnoser is invoked that predicts the possible $ O $-nodes that can be
directly
reached from $ z_7 $ using the `{Reachable $ O $-node set $ RS_{z_i}' $ }
defined in Definition \ref{def:reachable o node set}. $ RS_{z_7} $ is: $ (
z_0, z_1, \cdots, z_{20} ) $. For each $ O $-node in $ RSz_7 $, the incoming
$ G $-transition(s) are checked against the $ G $-transition $ \tau'_{15} $.
Only the $ O $-node $ z_{11} $ remains out of all the
reachable $ O $-node(s), that fulfills the criteria of reachability and has
an incoming $ O $-transition $ a_{15} $ caused by $ G $-transition $
\tau'_{15} $. So, the diagnoser marks $ z_{11} $ as its current state and
continues the fault diagnosis. As the $ O $-node $ z_{11} $ traversed by the
diagnoser is an $ F_i $-certain $ O $-node, the system is under fault
(attack) condition. Thus, the MIDES framework helps to detect the
presence of \rds even if a measurement inconsistency occurs.
